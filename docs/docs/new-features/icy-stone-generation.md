This feature introduces a new type of bluish stone, called Icy Stone.

Icy Stone naturally generates in Taiga & Tundra biomes, along with this, Icy Ores of all kinds are generated & Icy Stone drops Icy Cobblestone when broken.

Additionally, all Icy variants can be used in recipes in place of their vanilla counterparts, although they can't be mix & matched.
