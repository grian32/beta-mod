### Sawmill

Adds a new block called the Sawmill.

The sawmill allows players to convert planks to stairs & slabs at a 1:2 rate for slabs & 1:1 rate for stairs.

This block is configured by placing the desired output block (i.e slab or stair) on the side of the block where the texture indicates it.
Once the block is configured, you can right click with a stack of planks and it will convert them to the output.

Please keep in mind that it will convert the entire stack you are holding to the configured output.

### Redstone Blocks
:::note
Redstone Blocks currently do not feature redstone functionality, this is coming soon however.
:::

Redstone Blocks have been backported from 1.5.2. They have the same recipe as all other ore storage blocks.

### Nether Glass

Nether Glass is red tinted glass that can be made via smelting Soul Sand in a furnace.

The beta renderer does not support colored transparency, so this is only tinted on the solid colors. Implementing this in the renderer is planned as part of this mod.

### Pile of Logs

Adds Pile of Logs, which is a decorative block that can also be used as an ingredient for certain enhancements.

Recipe:

[TODO]

### Saddle Decrafting

Adds a shapeless recipe that lets you decraft a saddle into 5 leather.

### Biomes in F3 Debug Menu

:::note
This is not configurable as it is a debug feature, if you need to configure this for whatever reason, please contact me & I will add it in.
:::

Adds a display in the F3 debug menu which shows what biome the player is currently in.

### Fence Collision Boxes

Fences now have smaller collision boxes as seen in the later versions
