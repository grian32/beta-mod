# Item Enhancements

Enhancements are my take on the enchantments added in later versions. 
This feature allows you to enhance your tools with various effects via the Enhancement Table, costing a set amount of a certain ingredient (usually a block, or an item)

Unlike enchantments, you can only have one enhancement per tool & if you wish to gain a higher tier of each enhancement then you must upgrade it using the Enhancement Table.
