# Grian's Beta Expansion
rian's Beta Expansion is a mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3, that aims to add new features that I thought were fun or made sense to add as a feature either to solve problems or introduce more content, while trying to stay true to the beta style/feel.

This mod is meant to be played standalone, it may work alongside other mods, but there may be compatibility issues.

The project is currently in pretty early stages & doesn't include much additional content as of now, a lot more is planned however, so stay tuned!

## Disclaimer

I have no association with and I do not claim to be the youtuber of the same name, it's an unfortunate coincidence, I have had this name for many years and many people know me by it, which means I cannot change it.

## Installation

1. Install the Babric Prism Instance available [here](https://github.com/babric/prism-instance)
2. Add the following mods: [Glass Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/glass-config-api), [Glass Networking](https://modrinth.com/mod/glass-networking), [Fabric Language Kotlin 1.10.18+kotlin1.9.22.](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin/version/1.10.18+kotlin.1.9.22), [StationAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/stationapi) & [Mod Menu Beta](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu-beta) to your mods folder.

## Current possible places of conflict with other mods

- Vanilla Overworld Gen - Mainly the Icy Stone generation in cold biomes detailed below.
:::danger
Item Enhancements modifies several vanilla blocks by adding blockstates to support certain features efficiently, this means that the Item Enhancements feature is not compatible with pre-existing worlds. At this time I believe there isn't much I can do.
