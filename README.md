# Grian's Beta Expansion

Grian's Beta Expansion is a mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3, that aims to add new features that I thought were fun or made sense to add as a feature either to solve problems or introduce more content, while trying to stay true to the beta style/feel.

This mod is meant to be played standalone, it may work alongside other mods, but there may be compatibility issues. Any places I expect incompatibilities to exist can be seen [here](https://grian32.github.io/beta-mod/docs/intro/#current-possible-places-of-conflict-with-other-mods) 

The project is currently in pretty early stages & doesn't include much additional content as of now, a lot more is planned however, so stay tuned!

## Disclaimer
