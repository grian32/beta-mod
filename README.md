### New
- You can now consume lapis which will lead to a 1.5x Speed Boost for 30 seconds. - Currently doesn't work with MP, this is WIP.

- Adds recipe that lets you decraft a saddle into 5 Leather as saddles have no realistic uses.
- Taiga/Tundra Biomes now generate with Icy Stone & all associated variants (i.e ores, etc.)
    - This can be enabled/disabled like every other new feature but it will only affect newly generated chunks. So if you do this on an existing world, you'll only get the icy stone generated in new chunks.
    - Currently WIP
- F3 Debug Menu now displays biome.
    - This is not configurable as it's for debugging.
- Adds a Sawmill Block
    - This block allows you to convert planks to stairs and slabs at a 1:2 rate for slabs and 1:1 rate for stairs
    - This block is configured by placing the desired output(i.e the slab or stair) on the left side of the block as indicated by the textures
    - Once there is a block configured, you can right click with a stack of planks and it will convert them to the output
    - Recipe: TODO

- The following items now break faster with pickaxes: Cobblestone Stairs, Redstone Ore, Furnace.
- Stairs now drop themselves.

### Configuration

All of the above New Features can be enabled/disabled individually, the fixes cannot be disabled.
